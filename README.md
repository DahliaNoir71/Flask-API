## Introduction
This project is a RESTful API built with Flask, designed to provide various services. The API is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use, leveraging several Python libraries for different functionalities such as geolocation, data handling, and machine learning.

## Features
- User management (CRUD operations)
- Data processing with Pandas
- Geolocation services with Geopy
- Machine learning models using Scikit-learn
- RESTful API design

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.7
- Flask
- Jinja2
- Werkzeug
- Click
- Geopy
- Networkx
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Pip
- Pytz
- Requests
- Scikit-learn
- Scipy
- Six

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
5. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
2. The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## API Endpoints
Here are some example endpoints. Refer to the code for a full list of available endpoints.

### User Management
- **GET /users**: Retrieve a list of users.

- **GET /users/<id>**: Retrieve a specific user by ID.
- **PUT /users/<id>**: Update a specific user by ID.
- **DELETE /users/<id>**: Delete a specific user by ID.

### Data Analysis
- **POST /data/process**: Process data with Pandas.

### Geolocation
- **GET /geo/address**: Get coordinates for a given address.

### Machine Learning
- **POST /ml/predict**: Get predictions from a machine learning model.
